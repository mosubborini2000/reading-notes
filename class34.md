How are releases and versioning related?
Versioning and releases are interconnected concepts in software development, particularly when it comes to publishing applications:

Versioning:

Definition: Versioning involves assigning unique identifiers (versions) to different states or iterations of a software application.
Purpose: Versioning helps track changes, updates, and improvements made to the application over time. It aids developers and users in understanding the evolution of the software.
Example: Versions are often represented in a format like MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3), where the MAJOR version may indicate significant changes, the MINOR version represents smaller enhancements, and the PATCH version denotes bug fixes.
Releases:

Definition: A release is a specific instance of a versioned application that is made publicly available.
Purpose: Releases represent stable and tested snapshots of the software ready for distribution to end-users.
Example: When a development team finalizes a set of features, fixes, or improvements, they may create a release, such as version 2.0, for deployment.
Relationship:

Each release corresponds to a specific version of the application.
Versioning provides a systematic way to manage and communicate changes between releases.
Releases are often identified by their version numbers, indicating the state of the application at that point in time.

What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?
1-
Configure your app for release: At a minimum, you need to make sure that logging is disabled and removed and that your release variant has debuggable false for Groovy
2-Build and sign a release version of your app: You can use the Gradle build files with the release build type to build and sign a release version of your app
3-Test the release version of your app: Before you distribute your app, you should thoroughly test the release version on at least one target handset device and one target tablet device
4-Update app resources for release: Make sure that all app resources, such as multimedia files and graphics, are updated and included with your app or staged on the proper production servers.
5-Prepare remote servers and services that your app depends on: If your app depends on external servers or services, make sure they are secure and production ready.
