Strong typing refers to the concept of enforcing strict data type rules in a programming language. In Java, being strongly typed means that each variable and expression must have a defined data type, and the compiler ensures that operations on variables are valid based on their data types. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process and promotes code reliability.

What are the primitive data types? In Java, primitive data types are the basic building blocks used to represent simple values. They are not objects and do not have methods like regular classes. The primitive data types in Java are:

byte: 8-bit integer
short: 16-bit integer
int: 32-bit integer
long: 64-bit integer
float: 32-bit floating-point number
double: 64-bit floating-point number
char: 16-bit Unicode character
boolean: true or false value
XKCD: Compiling The XKCD comic humorously depicts the process of software compilation, showing a "compiling" progress bar that humorously extends to an absurd duration. It reflects the common perception among developers that compilation can sometimes take longer than expected, leading to amusing frustration.

Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript. When you write code in Java, the code needs to be compiled before it can be executed. Compilation means converting human-readable code into machine-readable code, which the computer can understand and run. This process is done by a compiler, and it ensures that the code is free of errors before it runs.

In contrast, JavaScript does not require explicit compilation. JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that the code is executed directly by a JavaScript engine in a web browser without a separate compilation step. This allows for more dynamic and flexible coding, but it also means that errors may be detected during runtime rather than during compilation.

Code compilation is an essential step in the software development process, but it does not guarantee that the code will work correctly in all scenarios. Compilation mainly checks for syntax errors and ensures that the code follows the language's rules. However, it may not catch logical errors or runtime issues. Comprehensive testing and debugging are necessary to ensure that the code works correctly under various conditions.

How many keywords does Java have? Java has a total of 50 keywords that are reserved and have specific meanings in the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, class names, etc.) in Java programs.

How do you print words to the console in Java? To print words to the console in Java, you can use the System.out.println() method.
