Explain to a non-technical friend what a GET request is.

Imagine you're browsing the internet, and you click on a link to view a webpage. In this simple act of clicking, you're making a GET request. It's like asking a server, "Hey, can you please show me this page?" The server then responds by sending you the webpage you requested.
