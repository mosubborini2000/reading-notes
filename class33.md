Asynchronous actions are actions that can be performed without blocking the main thread of an application. This means that the application can continue to respond to user input and other events while the asynchronous action is being performed.

Asynchronous actions are often used for tasks that take a long time to complete, such as network requests or database queries. By performing these tasks asynchronously, the application can remain responsive and avoid freezing.

common examples of asynchronous actions include handling I/O operations (such as reading from or writing to a file, making network requests), dealing with user input, and performing operations that may take a variable amount of time to complete.

Benefits of asynchronous methods:

Improved performance: Asynchronous methods can improve the performance of an application by allowing the main thread to continue working while long-running tasks are being performed.
Increased scalability: Asynchronous methods can help an application to scale more effectively by allowing it to handle more concurrent requests.
Better user experience: Asynchronous methods can provide a better user experience by preventing the application from freezing while long-running tasks are being performed.
