Analogy for Built-In Packages:

 Each compartment contains tools designed for specific tasks. The toolbox comes with some standard compartments (built-in packages) that are included by default, and they cover common needs. For specialized tasks, you can add custom compartments (user-defined packages) to your toolbox. Built-in packages provide a set of pre-made tools that you can use right away without having to create them from scratch.

Examples of Built-In Packages in Java:

java.lang: This package contains fundamental classes and is automatically imported in every Java program. Examples include String, Integer, Object, and System.

java.util: This package provides utility classes like ArrayList, HashMap, and Scanner that offer functionalities for data structures, input/output operations, and other utilities.

java. io: This package contains classes for handling input and output operations, such as File, FileInputStream, and PrintWriter.

Steps for Creating a New Package in IntelliJ:

Open IntelliJ and your project.

Right-click on the "src" folder (or the package where you want to create the new package).

Go to "New" and then select "Package."

Enter the name of the new package, following the Java naming conventions (e.g., com.example.myproject).

Click "OK" to create the new package.

Loop Types that Use a Loop Counter:

The loop types that use a loop counter are:

For Loop: A for loop in Java is controlled by a loop counter or index variable. It specifies the initialization, condition, and update expressions. The loop iterates until the condition becomes false.

Do-While Loop: Although a do-while loop does not explicitly have a loop counter, it still uses a loop counter conceptually. The loop's condition is evaluated after each iteration, so the loop executes at least once.

Difference Between While and Do-While Loops:

While Loop: In a while loop, the loop condition is checked at the beginning. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. If the condition is false from the start, the loop body might never execute.

Do-While Loop: In a do-while loop, the loop body is executed first, and then the loop condition is checked. The loop will execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

Three Built-In Methods for Arrays in Java:

Arrays.toString(): This method returns a string representation of the contents of an array. It is helpful for printing arrays in a readable format.

Arrays.sort(): This method sorts the elements of an array in ascending order. For arrays of primitive types, it uses quicksort, while for arrays of objects, it uses merge sort.

Arrays.copyOf(): This method creates a new array and copies the elements from the original array into the new one. It allows you to create a new array with a specific length.

Determining the Size of an Array in Java:

In Java, you can determine the size of an array using the length property. For example, if you have an array named arr, you can find its size by calling arr.length. Note that the length property is not a method but a public final instance variable, so you don't need parentheses when accessing it. The length represents the number of elements in the array.
