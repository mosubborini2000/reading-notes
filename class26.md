Explicit Intent: It is used to specify a particular component (e.g., an Activity or a Service) to be started. This is typically used when you know exactly which component you want to launch within your app.



Implicit Intent: It is used when you don't specify a particular component and allow the Android system to determine the appropriate component to handle the request based on the intent's action, data, and category. Implicit intents are commonly used for actions like sending emails, sharing content, or opening a web URL.



An Activity in Android is a fundamental building block of an application, representing a single screen with a user interface. Activities are used to present the user with a graphical user interface (UI), and they are responsible for managing the interaction between the user and the app. Activities can range from simple screens, like a login form or a settings page, to more complex screens, like a map view, video player, or a social media feed.

Activities are often used for various purposes in an Android app, including:

Displaying the main user interface.
Collecting and presenting data.
Handling user interactions.
Navigating between different screens or activities within the app.
