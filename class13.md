1. Name a few real-life examples of "One To Many" relationships.

Sure, here are a few real-life examples of "One-to-Many" relationships:

Author and Books: One author can write many books, but each book is written by one author.
Teacher and Students: A teacher can have many students in their class, but each student has only one teacher.
Parent and Children: A parent can have multiple children, but each child has only two parents (usually).
Customer and Orders: A customer can place multiple orders, but each order is placed by one customer.
2. Given two entities, one named Player and one named Team, if you wanted to create a one-to-many relationship with those entities which would be the one and which would be the many?

In a one-to-many relationship between Player and Team, typically, "Team" would be the "one," and "Player" would be the "many." This means that one team can have many players, but each player belongs to only one team.

3. Explain one-to-many relationships to a non-technical friend.

Sure, imagine you have a box of colored pencils and a piece of paper. In this case, the box of colored pencils represents the "one," and the piece of paper represents the "many."

You can have one box of colored pencils, and inside that box, you have many different colored pencils. Each colored pencil belongs to that one box. So, in a one-to-many relationship, you have one thing on one side (like the box of colored pencils) and many related things on the other side (like the individual colored pencils inside the box).

4. Describe the difference between a unit test and an integration test.

Unit Test: A unit test is focused on testing a small, isolated piece of code, typically a single function or method in your software. It aims to verify that this specific unit of code behaves as expected. Dependencies are usually mocked or stubbed to isolate the unit under test from the rest of the application.

Integration Test: An integration test, on the other hand, tests how different units or components of your software work together. It checks whether these units can communicate and interact correctly when integrated. Integration tests often involve real dependencies, such as databases, APIs, or external services, to ensure that the entire system functions as intended when these components are connected.

5. What is the object that provides support for Spring MVC Testing?

In Spring, the object that provides support for Spring MVC Testing is the MockMvc object. MockMvc is part of the Spring Test framework and allows you to simulate HTTP requests and responses for testing your Spring MVC controllers without actually starting a web server. It's a powerful tool for testing the behavior of your controllers and verifying that they handle requests and produce responses as expected.

6. What does the "perform()" method do in a Spring integration test?

In Spring integration testing with MockMvc, the perform() method is used to simulate an HTTP request to a specific endpoint or URL and capture the resulting HTTP response. It allows you to perform actions such as sending GET or POST requests to your controllers and then inspecting the response to make assertions about the behavior of your application.

For example, you can use perform() to send a GET request to a controller method and then use assertions to check if the response status code, content, or any other aspects of the response match your expectations. It's a key method for writing and executing tests to ensure that your Spring MVC controllers are functioning correctly.
