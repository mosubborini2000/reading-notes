A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that adheres to certain constraints and principles. Here are some key characteristics of a RESTful API:

Statelessness: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state. This promotes scalability and simplifies the client-server interaction.

Resources: Resources are the core abstractions in REST. Every resource should be uniquely identifiable through a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Resources can represent data objects, services, or entities.

HTTP Verbs: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

Representations: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML, to allow clients to choose the format they prefer.

Uniform Interface: The API should have a uniform and consistent set of conventions for interacting with resources, making it easier for clients to understand and use the API.

What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?
Benefits of using GraphQL:

Flexible Queries: GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data. This can improve network efficiency and application performance.

Single Endpoint: GraphQL typically provides a single endpoint for all data requests, simplifying client-server communication and reducing the number of network requests.

Strongly Typed: GraphQL uses a strongly typed schema, which provides clear documentation for available data types and operations.

Downsides of using GraphQL:

Complexity: Building and maintaining a GraphQL API can be more complex than a REST API, especially for developers who are new to the technology.

Lack of Caching: Traditional REST APIs benefit from built-in caching mechanisms like HTTP caching. In GraphQL, caching must be handled at the client side, which can be challenging.

Over-fetching: While GraphQL allows precise data requests, it can also lead to clients requesting too much data if not carefully managed.

Describe "serverless" to a new 301 Code Fellows student:
Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that abstracts away the need to manage traditional server infrastructure. Instead of provisioning and maintaining servers, serverless allows developers to focus on writing code and deploying applications while the cloud provider handles the underlying server management
