How are query methods defined when using Spring Data JPA?
Query methods in Spring Data JPA are defined by creating method signatures in your repository interface. By adhering to a specific naming convention, Spring Data JPA will automatically generate the appropriate SQL queries at runtime. For example, if you have a method in your repository interface named findByFirstName(String firstName), Spring Data JPA will generate a query to find entities where the "firstName" attribute matches the provided value.

Which dependencies will you need in order to complete the Spring guide?
The dependencies required to use Spring Data JPA typically include:

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: This is the main dependency for Spring Data JPA and includes the core functionality.
spring-boot-starter-web: This is often added if you want to create RESTful web services or web applications.
spring-boot-starter: This is the core Spring Boot starter that provides basic functionality.
What annotations are used to specify an auto-generated identification number for an Entity?
To specify an auto-generated identification number for an entity in Spring Data JPA, you can use the @Id annotation for the primary key field and @GeneratedValue to specify the generation strategy for the identifier. For example:
@Entity
public class Student {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
}

Which of the Spring Data Repositories covered in the readings has the most methods available to it?
Among the Spring Data Repositories, JpaRepository has the most methods available to it. It provides a wide range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for working with entities, as well as additional query methods.

Name a downside of a Spring Data Repository.
One potential downside of using a Spring Data Repository is that it might lead to excessive code generation. If your domain model is complex with many entities, repositories, and query methods, the generated code can become difficult to manage and understand. Additionally, it might generate SQL queries that are not optimized for specific use cases, leading to performance issues. In such cases, custom query methods or native SQL queries may be needed.

How would you define an operation to find a student based on their name in a repo named StudentRepository which extends JpaRepository?
You can define a method in the StudentRepository interface by following the Spring Data JPA naming convention. To find a student based on their name.

This method will find all students whose "firstName" attribute matches the provided value and return a list of matching students. The method name, findByFirstName, follows the naming convention, where "findBy" is the prefix for the field you want to use in the query, and "FirstName" is the name of the entity's attribute.
