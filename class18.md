## Significance of a Join Table:

In a many-to-many relationship, a join table (also known as a junction table or pivot table) is significant because it acts as an intermediary between the two related entities. Its main purpose is to store the associations between records in the two tables.
## Values Held Within a Join Table:
The join table primarily contains foreign keys, which are references to the primary keys of the two entities involved in the many-to-many relationship.
