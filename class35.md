 WHY Graph Traversals?

Graphs are powerful data structures that represent relationships between entities. Traversing a graph, or moving through its vertices and edges, is a fundamental operation in graph theory and computer science. It allows us to discover the structure of the graph and find connections between different nodes.

II. Basics: WHAT is Graph Traversal?

Graph traversal involves systematically visiting each vertex and edge in a graph. There are two common methods: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Depth-First Search (DFS): Imagine exploring a maze. You go as deep as possible along one path before backtracking. In DFS, we start at a vertex, explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Picture dropping a pebble in the center of a pond. The ripples move outward in concentric circles. In BFS, we start at a vertex and explore its neighbors before moving on to their neighbors.

    A
   / \
  B - C
 / \
D - E

Depth-First Search:

Start at A.
Move to B.
Explore D.
Backtrack to B, explore E.
Backtrack to A, move to C.
Result: A, B, D, E, C

Breadth-First Search:

Start at A.
Move to B, C.
Explore D, E.
Result: A, B, C, D, E
