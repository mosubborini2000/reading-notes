## OOP:
 stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm or methodology that organizes software design around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their interactions within a program.

 ## Difference between an Object and a Class:

## Class:
 A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (fields) and methods (functions) that can operate on that data.
##Object:
 An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own unique data and can perform actions using the methods defined in its class.

Types of State a Student Object Might Have:

Name: A student object might have a name as part of its state.
Age: Another possible state could be the age of the student.
Types of Behaviors a Student Object Might Have:

Study: A student object could have a behavior to study, which might involve methods related to learning and education.

## Java Classes:
Significance of a Constructor for a Class: A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It initializes the object's state and performs any necessary setup. Constructors help ensure that objects are properly initialized and ready to use when they are created.

Declaration Statement for a Class Named "Student":

java

public class Student {
    // 
}

## Creating Objects:
we can create an objects from the class that we have by new word.

## Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Numbers:
Binary to Decimal:

Binary number 1101: Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. In the binary number 1101, we have:
1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13.
Therefore, the binary number 1101 is equivalent to the decimal number 13.
Decimal to Binary:

Decimal number 52: To convert a decimal number to binary, you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and note the remainders in reverse order.
52 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 0
26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0
13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1
6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 52 is 110100.
Decimal to Hexadecimal:

Decimal number 52 to hexadecimal: Hexadecimal uses base 16, so each digit represents a power of 16.
52 ÷ 16 = 3 remainder 4
In hexadecimal, the value 10 is represented as 'A', 11 as 'B', and so on. So, remainder 10 is 'A' and remainder 11 is 'B'. Since we have remainder 4, the hexadecimal representation of 52 is 34.
