Room is an Android library for database management that is wrapped around the SQLite database engine.

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based, and serverless database engine. 


Both Room and JPA are Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, which means they provide a way to map Java or Kotlin objects to database tables.
Both Room and JPA use annotations to define entities (objects that correspond to database tables) and relationships between entities.
They both provide a high-level and object-oriented way to work with databases, making it easier to interact with the underlying database system.
A DAO, which stands for Data Access Object, is a design pattern used to separate the application's business logic from the database access code. In the context of Room and Android development:

A DAO is an interface or class that defines the methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

DAOs in Room are annotated with @Dao and contain methods annotated with @Insert, @Update, @Delete, and @Query that specify the SQL operations to be performed on the database.
DAOs in Room simplify database interactions and promote clean, organized, and maintainable code by encapsulating all database-related logic in one place.
